# Useful Dot Net Things

##Includes:
- Winforms specific functions that help deal with the peculiarities of winforms, or just functions that operate on winforms objects.
- WPF specific functions that deal with WPF things like BitmapImages and FlowDocuments
- General things like IsPowerOfTwo
- Extension methods like AddRange for collections that don't support it (I know it's bad form)
